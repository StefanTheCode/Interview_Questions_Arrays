# 🧩 .NET Array Interview Questions – Complete Guide

This repository contains **20 essential array interview questions** for **.NET developers**.  
Each question comes with:  

- ✅ **Explanation** of the problem  
- ✅ **Multiple solutions** (from brute force to optimal)  
- ✅ **Performance analysis** (time & space complexity)  
- ✅ **Clean, commented C# class implementation**  

If an interviewer asks about **arrays**, mastering these **20 questions** gives you **~90% coverage** of what’s commonly asked in coding interviews.

## 📌 Why Arrays?

Arrays are **one of the first topics in any coding interview** because they:

1. Test **fundamental problem-solving skills**  
2. Require understanding of **loops, conditions, and indexes**  
3. Serve as a basis for **hashing, sorting, and algorithm design**  

Common tasks include **reversals, rotations, searching, frequency counting, subarray problems, and element manipulation**.

## 🎯 Probability of Being Asked

| Priority | Questions | Example Problems | Likelihood |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **High** | Reverse, Rotate, Missing Number, Intersection, First Non-Repeating, Palindrome, Max Subarray Sum, Pairs with Sum, Frequency Counting | “Rotate array by k”, “Find first non-repeating element” | **70–80%** |
| **Medium** | Max Product Subarray, Flatten 2D Array, Majority Element, Shuffle Array, Binary Search Variants, Remove Duplicates | “Find max product subarray”, “Remove duplicates” | **40–50%** |
| **Low** | Time Complexity of Access, Jagged vs Multidimensional, Resize Array, Sort Custom Objects | “What is array access complexity?” | **20–30%** |

💡 **Tip:**  
Focus on the **high priority questions first** if preparing under time constraints.

## ⚡ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** and open in **Visual Studio** or **Rider**.
2. Open any question file, e.g., `Q09_RotateArray.cs`.  
3. Read the **class summary** for the problem statement.  
4. Check **solutions in order** to see the evolution from brute force to optimal.  
5. Run the **usage example** in a console app to see results.

## 💡 Extra Interview Tips

- **Start with the simplest solution first**, even if it’s O(n²).  
  - Interviewers often want to see your **thinking process** first.  
- **Explain time and space complexity** of each approach.  
- **Optimize step by step**: move from brute force → hashing → two-pointer → in-place.  
- **Mention edge cases**:  
  - Empty arrays  
  - Single element arrays  
  - Negative numbers  
  - Duplicates

## 📊 Coverage and Confidence

If you **master these 20 questions**:

- **90%** coverage of typical array coding interviews  
- **70–80%** chance your problem is a **direct variant** of one of these  
- **Great practice for LeetCode Easy/Medium array problems**
